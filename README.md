Resources to learn all about git

I hope you're having a wonderful time at Afrotech Fest!

Whether you know a little or a lot about git and Github I hope you'll find something interesting here.

There are two main ways to interact with git; through a GUI (graphical user interface) client or through the command line.

I'll be concentrating on command line usage in this workshop, but if you're more comfortable with [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or one of the many other graphical tools available that's also cool!

If you've never used the command line before, it can definitely be a bit intimidating. Don't worry though, you really don't need to know much to get going, and even less to be ~dangerous~ functional in a software team.
